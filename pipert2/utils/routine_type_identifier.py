    Group routines by their inferred type.
    Types:
        GENERATOR_ROUTINE - Routine that only produces data and send via queue
        INNER_ROUTINE - Routine that receives data from another source, produces new data and send it via queue
        FINAL_ROUTINE - Routine that receives data from another source, performs manipulation and doesn't send
        it to another routine.

    Args:

    Returns:
        Dictionary of key-string and value-Set[Routine] where key is one of three:

            INNER_ROUTINE
