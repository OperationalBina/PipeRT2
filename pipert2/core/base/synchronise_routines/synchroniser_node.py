class SynchroniserNode:
    """The SynchroniserNode is used in order to synchronise the fps throughout  the pipe.
     To achieve that, we need to synchronise each sub logic with each other.

    - The first step is updating the real fps of the current node.

    - The second step is calculating the minimum fps between {all the sub logics, take their max value}.
        When taking the max value of the sub logics, we handle the max fps that necessary.

    - The third step is calculating the minimum fps between {all the node owners, take their max value}.
        When taking the max value of the node owner, we handle the max fps that necessary from the owners.

    - The forth step is notifying the fps.

    - The fifth step is reset the flags. Because some node can be shared between two owners, and it already notified or
        updated with the realtime fps, then raise a flag for not notifying or updating twice.

    Simple Examples -
    Let's say A -> B -> C. A = 15, B = 10, C = 6. So the second step set the A,B = 6.
    Let's say A -> B -> C. A = 2, B = 5, C = 10. So the second step doesn't change a thing,
        and the third step set B,C = 2.
